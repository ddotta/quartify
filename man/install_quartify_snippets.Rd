\title{Install quartify RStudio Snippets}
\usage{
install_quartify_snippets(backup = TRUE, path = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{backup}{Logical. If TRUE (default), creates a backup of your existing
snippets file before modifying it.}

\item{path}{Character. Custom path for the snippets file. If NULL (default),
uses the standard RStudio snippets location. For examples/tests, use tempdir().}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the path to the snippets file.
}
\description{
Installs useful RStudio snippets for working with quartify. These snippets
help you quickly insert common structures when writing R scripts that will
be converted to Quarto documents.
}
\details{
The following snippets are installed:

- **header**: Insert a standard R script header with Title, Author, Date, and Description
- **callout**: Insert a Quarto callout structure
- **mermaid**: Insert a Mermaid diagram chunk
- **tabset**: Insert a tabset structure


The snippets are installed in your RStudio snippets file for R:
- Windows: `%APPDATA%/RStudio/snippets/r.snippets`
- Mac/Linux: `~/.config/rstudio/snippets/r.snippets`

If you already have custom snippets, this function will append the quartify
snippets to your existing file. If quartify snippets were previously installed,
they will be automatically removed and replaced with the new version.

The function will automatically open the snippets file in RStudio if available.
Simply save the file (Ctrl+S / Cmd+S) to reload the snippets immediately
without restarting RStudio. Then type the snippet name (e.g., `header`)
and press Tab to insert the template.
